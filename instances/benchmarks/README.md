# Benchmarks

For this project we have created several benchmarks to test, validate and optimize our implementation on.
The benchmarks range over different sizes, layouts and number of agents to cover a wide spectrum of possible scenarios.

The benchmarks 1-5 are smaller sizes, 6-11 medium sizes and the randomly generated instances are the large instances.

Benchmark descriptions:

2: vertex constrain benchmark
3: 4 2x2 rooms with corridors
4: vertex constrain benchmark 2
5: 2 3x3 rooms with a corridor and robots are changing room and swapping positions
6: 2 3x3 rooms with a corridor and robots are swapping rooms
7: maze consinsting of 2x2 rooms and corridors 
8: shelfs
9: bigger rooms connected by one corridor with robots all switching rooms
10: bigger rooms connected by one corridor with 8 robots
11: 10 robots on 76 nodes
