# Benchmarks

For this project we have created several benchmarks to test, validate and optimize our implementation on.
The benchmarks range over different sizes, layouts and number of agents to cover a wide spectrum of possible scenarios.

The benchmarks 1-5 are smaller sizes, 6-11 medium sizes and the randomly generated instances are the large instances.


# Benchmark descriptions:

benchmark_2: vertex constrain benchmark

benchmark_4: vertex constrain benchmark 2

benchmark_5: 2 3x3 rooms with a corridor and robots are changing room and swapping positions

benchmark_6: 2 3x3 rooms with a corridor and robots are swapping rooms

benchmark_7: maze consinsting of 2x2 rooms and corridors 

benchmark_8: shelfs

benchmark_9: bigger rooms connected by one corridor with robots all switching rooms

benchmark_10: bigger rooms connected by one corridor with 8 robots

benchmark_11: 10 robots on 76 nodes
